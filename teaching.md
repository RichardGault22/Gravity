<h4> 1. Sets and Sequences </h4>
  
  - Nice [video] introducing sets with worked examples. **Note** we will not be using the *#* notation for the size of a set.

  - See also, Introduction to the Theory of Computation (Sipser, 2nd Edition), Pg 7+8 (including examples 0.8, 0.9).
  
<h4> 3. Logic </h4>

  - Notes from Oxford University (Philosophy) on Logic, Propositional and Predicate Calculus with some worked examples. Good guide to deriving propositions and predicates from natural language statements. (Sections 9.4, 10, 15-19 are not necessary for CSC2047 but are interesting topics related to our course material). Document found  [here].
